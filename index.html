<h1>spotify visualisation</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This is a visualisation that explores the music habits of Australians. It does this by comparing the history of 
  spotify songs that have charted in Australia with the availability and type of live music venues in Melbourne.

This was sourced from city of Melbourne public datasets as well as a dataset created using the spotify api that is 
available on Kaggle. 

This visualisation begins by exploring the relationship between genre, popularity, track length and release dates.
It then looks at the availability of music venues in Melbourne and explores the types of music venues that are on offer.

Finally, there is a closer look at the common or divergent characteristics that define popular music on spotify

<h2>Track lengths of spotify charting songs by genre and charting days since release</h2>
<p>alabama rap and easy listening are very short - and post-romantic era (classical)

south african house, venezualeuan hip hop are the longest by far, generally falling in a 2-4
minute window, with outliers being almost 6 minutes.

many "modern" genres such as hip hop, rap, dance pop are very recent songs that charted, 
whereas older genres, particularly adult standards - a genre aimed at music created 
between 1920-1980, obviously has a much wider range of release dates
notably this also includes classic soul
note the outlier of arkansas country

<h2>types of music venue in Melbourne</h2>
<p>One visual contains the map of all venues in greater Melbourne, the other lists the venues in the cbd (postcode 3000). 
There are many live music venues in Melbourne playing at least 2 shows a week. They are particularly dense in the CBD with the best public transport access and most foot traffic in Melbourne.
  This dataset was from 2019, it is highly likely this landscape has changed significantly in recent years, with many venues in Melbourne
  closing due to cost of living pressures
</p>

<div class="centre">
<div id="graph5">
</div>
</div>
<p>Most of the venues are bars, hotels and nightclubs - similar concept of alchol and music 
There are many venues with no type listed.
Also many places with a generic "venue" type which can cover a range of different performance types such as theatre, jazz, classical, edm, rock ect.
</p>
<h2>Genre most likely to chart</h2>
<div class="centre">
<div id="graph4">
</div>
</div>
<p>There are many Australian genres charting in Australia, indicating a level of non-uniformity with popular music across the rest of the world (especially America).
  Algorithm based internet services such as Spotify might be expected to have a certain amount of homogenisation across their recommended music, however this trend suggests that this is not the case.
  Non australian genres fall under pop and hip hop most often. Pop as a genre name is a misnomber most of the time as it is simply describing what is popular at any given point, so is always overrepresented in popular genre graphs.</p>
<h2>Energy and danceability</h2>
<div class="centre">
<div id="graph6">
</div>
</div>
<p>Adult standards is notable low on both the energy and danceability scales. Adult standards covers popular music from the 1920's-1980's, which was often considered to be the dance music of its time.
  It is interesting to see how much more "danceable" newer music is calculated to be.
Alternative metal is not considered to be danceable, but it is high energy.
The most energetic and danceable genre overall is considered to be East Coast hip hop.
</p>
<h2>Tempo compared to song duration</h2>
<div class="centre">
<div id="graph7">
</div>
</div>
<p>Tempo has a very wide range, from 50 bpm to 200 bpm (where 30bpm is considered to be the slowest musically viable tempo). 
Song duration is much more condensed, mostly fitting between 200,000 ms and 400,000 ms (3-6 minutes). The longest noted song is almost 16 minutes long, with a tempo of almost 150 bpm

This indicates that there is a very wide range of music that is considered popular, refuting claims by many that popular music is simple and formulaic (we would expect to see much denser plots if this was the case)
</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>hi I don't know what to do with this data :)</p>
