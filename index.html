<h1>spotify visualisation</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This is a visualisation that explores the music habits of Australians. It does this by comparing the history of 
  spotify songs that have charted in Australia with the availability and type of live music venues in Melbourne.

This was sourced from city of Melbourne public datasets as well as a dataset created using the spotify api that is 
available on Kaggle. 

This visualisation begins by exploring the relationship between genre, popularity, track length and release dates.
It then looks at the availability of music venues in Melbourne and explores the types of music venues that are on offer.

Finally, there is a closer look at the common or divergent characteristics that define popular music on spotify

<h2>Track lengths of spotify charting songs by genre and charting days since release</h2>
<p>alabama rap and easy listening are very short - and post-romantic era (classical)

south african house, venezualeuan hip hop are the longest by far, generally falling in a 2-4
minute window, with outliers being almost 6 minutes.

many "modern" genres such as hip hop, rap, dance pop are very recent songs that charted, 
whereas older genres, particularly adult standards - a genre aimed at music created 
between 1920-1980, obviously has a much wider range of release dates
notably this also includes classic soul
note the outlier of arkansas country

<h2>types of music venue in Melbourne</h2>
<p>one contains the map of all venues in greater Melbourne, the other lists the venues in the cbd (postcode 3000). 
Of note, there are many live music venues in Melbourne playing at least 2 shows a week. They are particularly dense in the CBD with the best public transport access and most foot traffic in Melbourne.

<h2>types of music venue in Melbourne</h2>
<p>Mostly bars, hotels and nightclubs - similar concept of alchol and music 
many venues with no type listed
also many with a generic "venue" which can cover a range of different settings
</p>
<h2>Genre most likely to chart</h2>

<h2>genre discussion</h2>
<p>good to note that there are many australian genres charting in australia. Non australian genres fall under pop and hip hop most likely. (pop is a misnomber in genre most of the time as it is simply describing what is popular at any point in time, so is always overrepresented in popular genre graphs)</p>
<h2>Energy and danceability</h2>
<div class="centre">
<div id="graph6">
</div>
</div>
<h2>Energy and danceability</h2>
<p>notice adult standards being low on both energy and danceability - think big band swing - in the day was considered to be dancing music often which is interesting
alternative metal is not considered to be danceable, but is high energy
the most energetic and danceable genre overall is considered to be east coast hip hop - shoutout america
</p>
<h2>Tempo compared to song duration</h2>
<div class="centre">
<div id="graph7">
</div>
</div>
<h2>Tempo compared to song duration</h2>
<p>Tempo is a very wide range, from 50 bpm to 200 bpm
however song duration is much more condensed, mostly fitting between 200,000 ms and 400,000 ms (3-6 minutes). The longest noted song is almost 16 minutes long at just under 150 bpm</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>hi I don't know what to do with this data :)</p>
